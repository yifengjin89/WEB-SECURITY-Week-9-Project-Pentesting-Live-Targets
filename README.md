# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue
Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection
- In "salesperson" page, attackers can perform a time delay attack to the database by typing salesperson.php?id=2' or sleep(3)=0--'

 - ![blue1-sql](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55426354/79946104-4bee4780-843d-11ea-803c-911d6d07c34b.gif)
 
Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation
- Login to he blue section, change it to public/hacktools/change_session_id.php to get the session ID. Then open another brower to change the session ID. You will automatically login

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration
- The green site expose the correctness of the user name, letting attackers can brute force all the combination of the user info stores in this site. For instances:
 If the username is accurate, with the user name pperson Log in was unsuccessful.
 If the username is not a user, Log in was unsuccessful.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting
- In the contact page, enter both of your name and feedback as '''<script>alert('YIFENG found the XSS!')</script>''' then go to the feedback. The alert will appear.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference
- Find the salepersons who are not in the list in the blue and green site. Just changed the id = 10, 11 in the red site and you will find them.

- ![red1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55426354/79947694-61b13c00-8440-11ea-8a5f-cae1fd7a389b.gif)


Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery
- Blue and Green will show "Error: invalid request" after I changed its csrd_token, but the red site does not required a CSRF token to perform any modification within user's information. 

- ![red2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55426354/79948009-03d12400-8441-11ea-9a66-3ed845c71eb7.gif)
